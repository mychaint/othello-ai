# Othello AI

[Othello][wiki1], also called Reversi, is a strategy board game for two players, played on an 8Ã—8 uncheckered board. There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks (often spelled "discs"), which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color.

This projects contains an Othello game and an AI trained by multiple machine learning algorithms. Recently, it is playing with online players and itself for reinforcement learning.
